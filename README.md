# Library Application :book:

This is a project created for my Software Development class, the teacher wanted us to understand the main concepts of a MVC application, so we created two apps with essentially the same back-end. 

The project was very simple, and I was able to complete the challenge and understand all pieces of it. This was also the first time I created a JSP application on my own, and I was asked to do a presentation for my colleagues afterward.
